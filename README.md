# NeuroEvolution-Car | Active: No
A project created using Unity to emulate cars learning how to drive on given race tracks

March 2020 - Present (Last Updated: June 25 2020)

My goals for this project is to learn in more detail about the specifics of the genetic algorithom combined with a neural network. I followed Daniel Shiffman's tutorials on his youtube channel "The Coding Train" in order to build my foundation. Rather than using a library to make a project with neural networks I wanted to learn the specifics of how a neural network ran under the hood. So after watching Daniel's series of "Flappy Bird" neuroevolution I translated his toy neural network to C# so I could run it with Unity. After this I was able to program a working, learning car.
